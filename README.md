Telecommunication Project:-
Load the Telecom dataset:
•	Start by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
•	Check the structure of the dataset, including variable names and data types.

Task 1.1: Aggregate user behavior information:
•	Group the data by user and calculate the following metrics: number of xDR sessions, session duration, total download and upload data, and total data volume for each application.
•	Create a new DataFrame with the aggregated information.

Task 1.2: Exploratory data analysis:
•	Handle missing values:
o	Identify missing values in the dataset and replace them with the mean of the corresponding column using the fillna() function.

•	Analyze basic metrics:
o	Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc.) for relevant variables to understand the dataset's central tendencies and variations.

•	Non-Graphical Univariate Analysis:
o	Compute dispersion parameters (e.g., standard deviation, range) for each quantitative variable to understand the spread of the data.
o	Interpret the dispersion parameters to gain insights into the dataset's distribution and variability.

•	Graphical Univariate Analysis:
o	Choose appropriate plotting options (e.g., histograms, box plots) for each variable to visualize their distributions.
o	Interpret the graphical representations to understand the data's distribution, skewness, and presence of outliers.

•	Bivariate Analysis:
o	Explore the relationship between each application and the total download and upload data using scatter plots or correlation matrices.
o	Interpret the findings to understand the impact of different applications on data usage.

•	Variable Transformations:
o	Segment users into the top five decile classes based on the total duration for all sessions.
o	Compute the total data (DL+UL) per decile class and analyze the distribution of data usage across these segments.

•	Correlation Analysis:
o	Compute a correlation
o	Interpret the findings to understand the impact of different applications on data usage.

•	Variable Transformations:
o	Segment users into the top five decile classes based on the total duration for all sessions.
o	Compute the total data (DL+UL) per decile class and analyze the distribution of data usage across these segments.


o	Interpret the results by identifying the most influential components and understanding their contribution to the overall variance.
•	Adding the data set in the sql
